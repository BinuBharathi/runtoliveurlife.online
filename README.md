            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through
            some intresting places on the way:

            I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
            road today: 
        </p>
            <blockquote>
                Passing cars,<br>
                When you can't see,<br>
                May get you,<br>
                A glimpse,<br>
                OF eternity.<br>
            </blockquote>
        <p>     
            I definetly won't be Passing any cars.

            My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
            everthing packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
            I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>celphone</li>
            <li>ipod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>and a protein bar</li>

        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just the essentials, As 
            Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
            thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
